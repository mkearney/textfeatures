\usage{
textfeatures(x, sentiment = TRUE, word_dims = NULL, normalize = TRUE,
  export = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input data. Should be character vector or data frame with character
variable of interest named "text". If a data frame then the first "id|*_id"
variable, if found, is assumed to be an ID variable.}

\item{sentiment}{Logical, indicating whether to return sentiment analysis
features, the variables \code{sent_afinn} and \code{sent_bing}. Defaults to
FALSE. Setting this to true will speed things up a bit.}

\item{word_dims}{Integer indicating the desired number of word2vec dimension
estimates. When NULL, the default, this function will pick a reasonable
number of dimensions (ranging from 2 to 200) based on size of input. To
disable word2vec estimates, set this to 0 or FALSE.}

\item{normalize}{Logical indicating whether to normalize (mean center,
sd = 1) features. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{export}{Logical indicating whether to store sufficient information for
exporting the feature extraction process (stores the means, standard deviations,
and the word2vec reference object, which can then be used to process new data).}
}
\value{
A tibble data frame with extracted features as columns.
}
\description{
Extracts features from text vector.
